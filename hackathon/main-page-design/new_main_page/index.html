      <h2>Problem Identification:</h2>
      <p>Private cameras in businesses, homes, and institutions play a crucial role in enhancing public safety and crime detection. Many private cameras lack clear locations, making it difficult for the police to efficiently access relevant video footage during investigations in specific crime-prone areas. <br> </p>
      <h2>Purpose of Geo-tagging:</h2>
    <p>Geo-tagging involves tagging cameras with precise location information.
        Geo-tagging aids police in crime investigations by providing a clear map-like location for private cameras, facilitating quick identification and access to crucial video footage.
        Enhances law enforcement's ability to gather evidence, understand the context of a crime, and expedite case resolution for overall public safety.
    </p>  
    <h2>Solution Needed:</h2>
    <p>Develop a comprehensive system to mark the location of private cameras for improved public safety and faster police response.
        Create a user-friendly system enabling law enforcement to easily identify the placement of each private camera, facilitating quick retrieval of specific video footage.
        Establish a standardized metadata format for geo-tagged information, including camera specifications, owner contact details, and camera visibility range.
        Geo-tagged Information: Include camera location data (latitude and longitude).
        Camera Specifications: Provide technical details such as model, resolution, and recording capabilities.
        Owner Contact Details: Include contact information for easy communication with the camera owner.
        Visibility Range: Specify the camera's field of view or range.
        Enable easy access for authorities to quickly understand and contact camera owners as needed.
        Implement image processing algorithms for analyzing large video streams to identify specific objects (e.g., people, buses, cars, motorcycles).
        Assign licenses to cameras for seamless interaction with the central Command and Control Center.
        Trigger real-time alerts for specific object identification, notifying the Command and Control Center of unauthorized persons or suspicious objects.
        Implement a mechanism to check if a camera installed at a specific location has been displaced, automatically notifying the need for repair. <br></p>
